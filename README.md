# Clay

Clay is a lightweight toolkit to build apps, games and frameworks on native platforms and web browser, written with the [Haxe Programming Language](https://haxe.org).

This is mostly a rewrite and a successor of the excellent snowkit's [snow](https://snowkit.github.io/snow/) library.

In fact, **Clay** keeps a substantial portion of **snow**'s codebase, and borrows some snippets from [luxe alpha](https://luxeengine.com/alpha) as well. It has then been reworked to focus on its own goals: Haxe 4 support, only keeping features that are not overlapping with [ceramic](https://github.com/ceramic-engine/ceramic) and adapting the code style.

Although it could be used as is. The intended usage of **Clay** is within [ceramic](https://github.com/ceramic-engine/ceramic) apps to provide native support of **Mac**, **Windows**, **Linux**, **iOS** and **Android** platforms as well as **Web** browsers using webgl.
